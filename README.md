# bootstrap_portfolio

## About
This portfolio is a simple "About Me" website that showcases my ability to use the Bootstrap framework to create responsive web pages using the grid system and my ability override default Bootstrap styling. 

The contact form is non functional. All projects listed on the *Portfolio* page are placeholders. All code within the project is my own.
